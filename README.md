## Slides
Slides are on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/fabianshallari/the-lazy-meta-programmers-guide-to-hilt-extensions)

## Disclaimer
The talk and the code are good enough to give you an idea of how to write your Hilt extensions, but they are not production-ready. 
The code is not tested and it's not guaranteed to work. It's just a proof of concept.
